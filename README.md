Email Automation Tool with OAuth Integration
Description
This project is a Node.js-based email automation tool that connects to Google and Outlook email accounts using OAuth. The tool reads incoming emails, categorizes them based on the content, assigns labels, suggests appropriate responses, and can send automated replies. It is implemented using TypeScript and utilizes BullMQ for task scheduling.

Features
OAuth2 authentication for Google and Outlook email accounts.
Read and categorize incoming emails.
Assign labels and suggest responses based on email content.
Automated email responses.
Task scheduling using BullMQ.
Prerequisites

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=your_google_redirect_uri

# Outlook OAuth2 credentials (optional)
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID=your_outlook_client_id
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_outlook_client_secret
OUTLOOK_REDIRECT_URI=your_outlook_redirect_uri
OUTLOOK_TENANT_ID=your_outlook_tenant_id

# Other configurations
BULL_REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
Replace the placeholder values with your actual OAuth credentials and other necessary configuration details.

4. Obtain OAuth2 Credentials
Google:
Go to Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or select an existing one.
Enable the Gmail API.
Create OAuth2 credentials and download the JSON file.
Copy the client_id, client_secret, and set the redirect URI.
Outlook:
Go to Microsoft Azure Portal.
Register a new application in Azure AD.
Obtain the client_id, client_secret, and tenant_id.
Set up the redirect URI.
5. Run the Application
To start the application locally, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run start
Or, if using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn start
6. Access the Application
Once the application is running, you can access it through your browser at:

plaintext
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
7. Connect Your Email Accounts
Visit /auth/google to connect your Google account.
Visit /auth/outlook to connect your Outlook account (if configured).
8. Scheduling Tasks with BullMQ
BullMQ is used for scheduling tasks such as checking for new emails periodically. The scheduling interval and other configurations can be adjusted in the application code.
